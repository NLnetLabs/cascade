Hardware Security Modules (HSMs)
================================

.. Note:: Cascade does not *require* a :term:`Hardware Security Module (HSM)`
   to operate. While it is common practice to secure cryptographic key 
   material using an HSM, not all operators use an HSM. Cascade is able to 
   use `OpenSSL <https://www.openssl.org>`_ and/or 
   `ring <https://crates.io/crates/ring/>`_ software cryptography to generate
   signing keys and to cryptographically sign DNS :term:`RRset <Resource 
   Record Set (RRset)>` data, storing the generated keys in on-disk files.

An Introduction to HSMs
-----------------------

A Hardware Security Module is typically a tamper proof hardware vault capable
of generating and securely storing cryptographic keys and performing signing
operations using those keys on data provided via an interface and returning
the signed result via the same interface.

HSM Interfaces
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In most cases, you interact with an HSM via an interface that is compliant
with the Oasis PKCS#11 (Public-Key Cryptography Standard) specification. Some
HSMs also or alternatively support a newer Oasis specification called KMIP
(Key Management Interoperability Protocol).

KMIP is a data (de)serialization protocol that operates on top of the widely
used TCP and TLS combination of protocols. As such, it requires no additional
software or special configuration to use and poses no direct security or
stability threat to the client process.

This is quite different to PKCS#11, which requires the HSM vendor to provide
a library of code that offers a C language style interface to be used by the
client at runtime by loading the library (a.k.a. module) into its own process
with no knowledge of or control over what that code is going to do.

Cascade and HSMs
----------------

Cascade supports both PKCS#11 and KMIP compatible HSMs. KMIP is supported
natively, while PKCS#11 is supported through our :program:`kmip2pkcs11` bridge.

Cascade is an application written in Rust. Crossing the divide between the Rust
host application and a loaded C library means giving up the stability and
memory safety guarantees offered by Rust. As such, Cascade was designed to
*not* load PKCS#11 modules directly but instead to hand that risk off to a
helper tool: :program:`kmip2pkcs11`.

To interact with a HSM over its PKCS#11 interface, Cascade sends KMIP requests
to :program:`kmip2pkcs11`, which executes them against a loaded PKCS#11 vendor
library.

Supported HSMs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In principle any HSM supporting PKCS#11 v2.40 or KMIP 1.2 should be supported.
To work with an HSM using its PKCS#11 interface, Cascade requires our
:program:`kmip2pkcs11` relay. 

Several HSMs have been tested with Cascade. Our testing was limited to normal
usage only, not attempting to deliberately cause problems, and not attempting
to stress or performance test the interface. The tested HSMs are:

.. Note:: Cascade requires TLS 1.3 for connections to the KMIP server, even
   though KMIP 1.2 requires servers to offer support for old versions of the
   TLS protocol with known security vulnerabilities. For this reason, Cascade
   cannot be used with PyKMIP as this implementation only supports older,
   vulnerable TLS versions.

Setting up kmip2pkcs11
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you installed Cascade via a DEB or RPM package you should also already
have the :program:`kmip2pkcs11` software installed, unless you explicitly
opted not to install it. You can also :doc:`build the software <building>`
from source.

.. seealso:: We provide man pages for both the 
   :doc:`kmip2pkcs11 daemon<kmip2pkcs11:man/kmip2pkcs11>` and
   :doc:`configuration file<kmip2pkcs11:man/kmip2pkcs11-config.toml>`.

When installed via a package the daemon will not be run automatically. This
is because you will need to:

- Edit the :doc:`kmip2pkcs11 configuration
  file<kmip2pkcs11:man/kmip2pkcs11-config.toml>` to set the location of your
  PKCS#11 module.
- Depending on your PKCS#11 module, you may need to set vendor specific
  environment variables for the :program:`kmip2pkcs11` process. 
  You may also need to ensure that vendor specific configuration files and 
  possibly other software is installed and correctly configured.
- Ensure that the :program:`kmip2pkcs11` user has access to the resources
  needed by the PKCS#11 module to be loaded.
- Use the (vendor specific) PKCS#11 module setup process to create a token
  label and PIN that Cascade should use to authenticate with the HSM.
- Optionally, generate a proper TLS certificate for use by
  :program:`kmip2pkcs11` and set the :option:`kmip2pkcs11:cert_path` and
  :option:`kmip2pkcs11:key_path` in :file:`/etc/kmip2pkcs11/config.toml` to
  point the certificate file and accompanying private key. If you omit these
  settings, :program:`kmip2pkcs11` will generate a long-lived self-signed TLS
  certificate each time it starts.

.. note:: There is currently no way to test that the 
   :doc:`kmip2pkcs11 configuration<man/kmip2pkcs11-config.toml>` is correct
   other than trying to use it with Cascade.

When ready, start :program:`kmip2pkcs11` either via systemd (if installed
from a package) or directly:

.. code-block:: bash

   kmip2pkcs11 --config /etc/kmip2pkcs11/config.toml -d --user <USER> --group <GROUP>

.. tip:: Use the :option:`kmip2pkcs11:--user` and 
   :option:`kmip2pkcs11:--group` arguments to make :program:`kmip2pkcs11`
   run as the same user that has access to any necessary resources required by
   PKCS#11 module vendor.

Using kmip2pkcs11 with Cascade
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To use :program:`kmip2pkcs11` with Cascade we must tell it that there is a HSM
running that it can connect to. In the instructions below the PKCS#11 token label
and PIN are the values you configured above.

.. code-block:: bash

   cascade hsm add --insecure --username <PKCS#11 token label> --password <PKCS#11 PIN> kmip2pkcs11 127.0.0.1

.. Note:: The :option:`--insecure` option must be used if using a self-signed
   TLS certificate, which is the default. 127.0.0.1 should be changed if your 
   :program:`kmip2pkcs11` instance is running on a different address.

Cascade will verify that it can connect and that the target server appears to be a
KMIP compatible HSM.

.. Note:: Cascade does **not** yet verify that the target KMIP server supports
   the :ref:`operations<kmip2pkcs11:index:supported operations>` needed by 
   Cascade. For :program:`kmip2pkcs11` this isn't a problem as it is designed
   to work with Cascade.

Next, we need to add the HSM to a policy so that when zones are added the keys for the
zones will be generated using the HSM.

To do this, edit :file:`/etc/cascade/policies/<your_policy>.toml` and set:

.. code-block:: text

   [key-manager.generation]
   hsm-server-id = "kmip2pkcs11"

Now when you use ``cascade zone add --policy <your_policy>`` the HSM will be used
for key generation and signing.
