.TH "CASCADED-POLICY.TOML" "5" "Oct 17, 2025" "0.1.0-alpha2" "Cascade"
.SH NAME
cascaded-policy.toml \- Cascade policy file format
.sp
A policy is a collection of settings that apply to a group of zones known to
Cascade.  Policy controls how Cascade operates on those zones, e.g. how they
are signed. This page describes all possible settings and their defaults. You
can generate a template with these default values using \fBcascade template
policy\fP\&.
.sp
Policy files are managed by the user, and are stored at a configurable path
(by default, \fB/etc/cascade/policies\fP).  You can add, modify, and remove
policy files, then update Cascade with \fBcascade policy reload\fP\&.  Note that:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Cascade maintains an internal copy of all policies, and will use this until
\fBcascade policy reload\fP is used.  If reloading fails, Cascade will continue
to use its existing internal copy.  It won\(aqt reload policies if it restarts.
.IP \(bu 2
Policies cannot be removed if they are attached to zones; those zones need
to be deleted or shifted to a different policy first.  If you remove a used
policy and reload policies in Cascade, it will fail and continue to use its
internal copy of the policy.
.IP \(bu 2
Only policy files stored in the configured policy directory and having a
\fB\&.toml\fP extension will be loaded by Cascade.\(ga
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0

In the current alpha release, changes to some policy options (e.g. review
hook) also require a server restart in addition to running \fBcascade policy
reload\fP to take effect.

How long keys are considered valid for.
.sp
If a key has been used for longer than this time, it is considered expired,
and (if enabled) it will automatically be rolled over to a new key.  Even if
automatic rollovers are not enabled, the key will be reported as expired.
This is a soft condition \-\- DNSSEC does not have a concept of key expiry,
and it will not break DNSSEC validation, but it is usually important to the
security of the zone.

Independent validity times are set for KSKs, ZSKs, and CSKs.  An integer
value will be interpreted as seconds; \fBforever\fP means keys never expire.

Whether to automatically start key rollovers.
.sp
If this is enabled, Cascade will automatically start rolling over keys when
they expire (as per \fBvalidity\fP).  When using this setting, \fBvalidity\fP must
not be set to \fBforever\fP\&.
.sp
The first step in a rollover will be to generate new keys to replace old
ones. By disabling this setting, the user can manually control how new keys
are generated, and when rollovers happen.

If this is enabled, Cascade will automatically contact public DNS servers to

to wait until some records are visible globally to progress key rollovers.  If
this is disabled, the user will have to inform Cascade when these conditions
are reached manually.

For this setting to work, Cascade must have network access to the zone\(aqs
public nameservers and the parent zone\(aqs public nameservers.

Like \fBauto\-report\fP, if this setting is enabled, Cascade will automatically

\fBauto\-done\fP specifically affects automatic checks for the last step of key
rollovers, and is independent from \fBauto\-report\fP\&.

.UNINDENT
.SS The management of DNS records by the key manager.

.sp
The key manager generates and signs several records (DNSKEY and CDS).  This

.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B cds.signature\-inception\-offset = 86400
The offset for generated signature inceptions.
.sp
Record signatures have a fixed inception time, from when they are considered
valid.  An imprecise computer clock could cause signatures to be considered
invalid, because their inception point appears to be some time in the future.
To prevent such cases, this setting allows the inception time to be offset
into the past.
.sp
Independent offsets can be set for each type of record.  An integer value is
intepreted as seconds; inception times will be calculated as \fBnow \- offset\fP
at the time of signing.

.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0

.B cds.signature\-lifetime = 1209600
The lifetime of generated signatures.
.sp
Record signatures have a fixed lifetime, after which they are considered
invalid.  To keep the zone valid, the signatures should be regenerated before
they expire; see \fBsignature\-remain\-time\fP to control regeneration time.
.sp
Independent lifetimes can be set for each type of record.  An integer value is

.B cds.signature\-remain\-time = 604800
The amount of time remaining before expiry when signatures will be
regenerated.
.sp
In order to prevent a zone\(aqs signatures from appearing invalid, they
have to be regenerated before they expire.  That hard limit is set by
\fBsignature\-lifetime\fP above.  This setting controls how long before expiry
signatures will be regenerated; it must be less than the \fBsignature\-lifetime\fP
setting.
.sp
Independent waiting times can be set for each type of record.  An integer

.B use\-csk = false
Whether to generate CSKs, instead of separate ZSKs and KSKs.
.sp
A CSK (Combined Signing Key) takes the role of both ZSK and KSK for a zone,
unlike the standard practice of using separate keys for ZSK and KSK.  This
setting does not affect how DNSSEC validation is performed, only procedures
for key rollovers.

.B algorithm = \(dqECDSAP256SHA256\(dq

The same algorithm and parameters will be applied to the ZSK and KSK.
