Cascade is a flexible DNSSEC signing pipeline. For more information, visit
the [Cascade landing page](https://blog.nlnetlabs.nl/cascade/).

An alpha release is available now, we encourage you to test it. If you have
questions, suggestions or feature requests, don't hesitate to [reach
out](mailto:cascade@nlnetlabs.nl)!

## Installation

Getting started with Cascade is really easy by installing a binary package
for either Debian and Ubuntu or for Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and
compatible systems such as Rocky Linux.

We host packages on packages.nlnetlabs.nl, with a *main* repository for
production releases, and a *proposed* repository for alphas, betas, and
release candidates. Alternatively, you can build from the source code using
Cargo, Rustâ€™s build system and package manager.

Please refer to our [comprehensive
documentation](https://cascade.docs.nlnetlabs.nl/) to learn what works best
for you.

## Join Us On Our Journey

Based on your feedback, we will continue work to offer a production grade
release of Cascade in Q1 of 2026. Please do not use the current codebase in
production.
