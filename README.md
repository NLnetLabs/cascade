Cascade is a friendly DNSSEC signing pipeline. 

An [alpha release](https://github.com/NLnetLabs/cascade/releases) is
available now, we encourage you to test it. Read our [comprehensive
documentation](https://cascade.docs.nlnetlabs.nl/) to get started.
Based on your feedback, we will continue work to offer a production grade
release of Cascade in the first half of 2026. Please do *not* use the current
codebase in production.

If you have questions, suggestions or feature requests, don't hesitate to
create an [issue on GitGub](https://github.com/NLnetLabs/cascade/issues),
send us [an email](mailto:cascade@nlnetlabs.nl) or mention us on

## Feature Set

Cascade offers a pipeline where zones are loaded, signed and published in
several stages, letting you review and approve with automation at each step:

### Flexible Signing

Get started easily with sensible default settings based on industry best 
practices. Cascade can generate and use on-disk key files and does *not 
require* a Hardware Security Module (HSM) to operate. For operators 
wishing to use an HSM, Cascade can connect to [PKCS#11 and KMIP 
compatible HSMs](https://cascade.docs.nlnetlabs.nl/en/latest/hsms.html).

### Bespoke Zone Verification

Using [Review
Hooks](https://cascade.docs.nlnetlabs.nl/en/latest/review-hooks.html),
Cascade supports optional verification of your zone data at two critical
stages: verification of the unsigned zone, and verification of the signed
zone. These review hooks can be used to perform any validation you require to
ensure your zone is correct at all stages, using any (third-party) tools
desired.

### Controllability

Cascade gives you tight control over [key
management](https://cascade.docs.nlnetlabs.nl/en/latest/key-management.html),
automation of key rolls and the DNSSEC signing process.

## Installation

Install Cascade from a [binary 
package](https://cascade.docs.nlnetlabs.nl/en/latest/installation.html) for 
either Debian and Ubuntu or for Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and compatible 
systems, such as Rocky Linux. Alternatively, you can [build from the source 
code](https://cascade.docs.nlnetlabs.nl/en/latest/building.html) using Cargo, 
Rustâ€™s build system and package manager.
