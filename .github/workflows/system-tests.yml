# This workflow is primarily for use with https://github.com/nektos/act and has
# been tested using the full image (catthehacker/ubuntu:full-latest).
#
# Further documentation is in TESTING.md.
#
# TL;DR:
#   - Docker: `act --network default -W .github/workflows/system-tests.yml --job your-test`
#   - Podman: `act --network podman -W .github/workflows/system-tests.yml --job your-test`
#   Optionally start a standalone artifact server to deduplicate compilation between tests (see TESTING.md).
#
# ## Example test job
